Have you ever just wanted to hear anime ops from your favorite anime, but youtube is being terrible about it? What if you could just point a program at your blu-ray backups folder and it would Make It Work?

Now you can! Get the code from: https://github.com/freeone3000/anime-op-randomizer

usage: test.py [folder]

tested with VLC; works with AppleTV.
It is still *very rough*, but it's good enough for this week! If you're still interested I may update further, but no promises.
